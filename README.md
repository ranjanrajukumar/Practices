✅ What is Middleware in ASP.NET Core?

In ASP.NET Core, middleware is software that sits in the HTTP request pipeline and processes requests and responses.

Each middleware component can:

✔ Read request
✔ Modify request
✔ Pass the request to the next middleware
✔ Short-circuit the pipeline
✔ Modify the outgoing response
